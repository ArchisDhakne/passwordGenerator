# passwordGenerator

IN this file i have made a password generartor which will genrate random password on our click we can also add numbers and special characters in the password if we want to make it stronger 
and in the end i have genrated a function which will copy that password to clipboard 
So one can click on that copy button and will be able to copy the randomly generated password

I also have added some special effects to it upon copying the password so it will help user to know that it has copyed the password
